On 19 June 2019, Chennai city, a city in India, officials declared that "Day Zero", or the day when almost no water is left, had been reached, as all the four main reservoirs supplying water to the city had run dry. People had to walk many, many kilometers to get water to drink. This later came to be known as ‘The 2019 Chennai Water Crisis’. Chennai isn’t alone. Major cities all around the world face water shortages during summer. Millions of people die due to water shortages each year. According to UNICEF [1], 2/3rd of the entire world faces severe water scarcity for at least 1 month per year. The credit of this water shortage usually goes to poor planning and management of the water that is received during monsoon each year. I have myself faced this shortage of water many times in my hometown. I am extremely interested in AI and for this hackathon, came up with a solution to this problem with an AI model.
